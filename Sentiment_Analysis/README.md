# Sentiment Analysis with R
Sentiment analysis is the interpretation and classification of emotions (positive, negative and neutral) within text data using text analysis and NLP techniques.
It allows businesses to identify customer sentiment toward products, brands or services in online conversations and feedback, and widely applied to voice of the customer materials, reviews and survey responses, online and social media, healthcare materials for applications that range from marketing to customer service to clinical medicine.

For my porject I conduct two different sentiment analysis:
- [Part 1 Structured Data](https://github.com/AnahitaS/Text_sentiment_analysis_R/tree/main/Text_Analysis): is about text analysis including text pre-processing, removing stop words, stemming, calculating word frequencies, word associations, and visualizing data by creating wordclouds.
- [Part 2 Unstructured Data](https://github.com/AnahitaS/Text_sentiment_analysis_R/tree/main/Text_Analysis): In Part 2 I focus on sentiment analysis. I will conduct sentiment analysis both for structured data (e.g., Twitter data) and unstrcutured data (raw text files).
